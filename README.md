## About

This project implements an animated login page (or login form) using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript — no external frameworks required. It’s intended as a demo/template for a login UI that you can embed in any website or expand to include backend logic (authentication, form handling, etc.).

## Features

- Animated login form — smooth transitions/effects for input fields, buttons, background or UI elements  
- Clean, modern design and user-friendly interface  
- Responsive layout (works on desktop and mobile) — adapt styling as needed  
- Easy to integrate: standalone HTML + CSS + JS, simple to plug into any web project  

*(Optional — if your project includes additional features, list them here, e.g., password-reset UI, custom validations, dark mode etc.)*

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** — structure (`index.html`)  
- **CSS** — styling and animations (`style.css`)  
- **JavaScript** — handling interactivity and animation logic (`script.js`)  

No build tools or dependencies — pure frontend static implementation.
